<h3> About Me </h3>

<paragraph> 
  I am a final-year undergraduate student in <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/undergraduate/programs/b-sc/joint-honours-mathematics-and-computer-science-b-sc">Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science</a> at McGill University. 
  I am also an undergraduate researcher at <a href=https://mila.quebec/en/>Quebec AI Institute (Mila)</a> and <a href=https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/>McGill NLP group</a>, supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/">Prof. Jackie Chi Kit Cheung</a>, 
and <a href=http://www.rahular.com/>Rahul Aralikatte</a>. Currently, my research primarily centers around text generation and efficient pre-training. 
  I am actively exploring other interesting topics. 
  For the academic year 2023-2024, I will serve as a Technical Project Manager at <a href="https://mcgillai.com/">McGill Artificial Intelligence Society</a>.
