# About Me


![myimg](assets/img/zcheng.png){: width="300px" style="float:right; padding:10px" }

I am a final-year undergraduate student in [Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/undergraduate/programs/b-sc/joint-honours-mathematics-and-computer-science-b-sc) at McGill University. I am also an undergraduate researcher at [Quebec AI Institute (Mila)](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [McGill NLP group](https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/), supervised by [Prof. Jackie Chi Kit Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/), and [Rahul Aralikatte](http://www.rahular.com/). Currently, my research is primarily focused on text generation and efficient pre-training. I am actively exploring other interesting topics. 


Previously, I participated in the [Google CS research mentorship program](https://research.google/outreach/csrmp/). For the academic year 2023-2024, I will serve as a Technical Project Manager at [McGill Artificial Intelligence Society (MAIS)](https://mcgillai.com/). The content that I develop for the MAIS bootcamp is available [here](https://ziling-cheng.github.io/mais202).
